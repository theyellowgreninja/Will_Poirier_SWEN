My name is Will Poirier.  
I went to *Spaulding High School* in Barre, VT.  
I am 18 years old.  
I enjoy playing video games, playing board games, and doing just a little bit of coding in my freetime.  
Too much coding gets too stressful to be super enjoyable though

What I want to learn from this class:
- Nothing
- I'm only in this class because I have to be
- I'm sure it has its uses but I'm also sure that I would rather learn these all in a different format
