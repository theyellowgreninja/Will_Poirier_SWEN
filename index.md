My name is Will Poirier.  
I went to *Spaulding High School* in Barre, VT.  
I am 18 years old.  
I enjoy playing video games, playing board games, and doing just a little bit of coding in my freetime.  
Too much coding gets too stressful to be super enjoyable though

What I want to learn from this class:
- To be perfectly honest I don't know what else I'm going to learn in this class
- I understand that it's all necessary to all of the non-coding aspects of Software Engineering
- But it's just kinda hard to know what that entails until I learn it
- I don't know what I don't know, you know?
